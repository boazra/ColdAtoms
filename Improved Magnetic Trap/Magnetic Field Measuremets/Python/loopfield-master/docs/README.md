LoopField
=========
This is a pythom module for calculating 3D vector magentic fields induced by filamentary current loops (i.e. turns of wire). The code is based on the formulas presented in:

Simpson J., Lane J., Immer C., Youngquist R., Steinrock, T., Simple  
Analytic Expressions for the Magnetic Field of a Circular Current  
Loop. NASA Technical Report. 2001.  
http://ntrs.nasa.gov/search.jsp?R=20010038494

The loofield.plot module can also generate 2D plots of the field lines in the XY plane.

Usage
=====
See the examples directory for several simple tests.  For example, the helmholtz_coil.py example produces the following plot:
